# Predicting Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML

## Task 1. Explore ecommerce data


[open ecommerce website database](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=data-to-insights&d=ecommerce&t=web_analytics&page=table)

nav menu > bigquery > 

in query editor
* to view the total visitors who visited our website, what % made a purchase?
```sql
#standardSQL
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```


* to see top 5 selling products
```sql
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

*  How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?
```sql
# visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

* were looking at different behaviors
    * first visit buy 
    * come back and forth dont buy
    * buy when they see the famous product
    * dont buy




## Task 2. Create a BigQuery dataset to store models and create the model
 

![](model_types.PNG)

resources > [project ID] > CREATE DATASET

|property|value|data|
|:------|:------:|------:|
|Dataset ID|ecommerce||

in query editor

* make a logistic_reg ML model for classification
    * ML is trying to preditct if the visitor will return and buy
    * features are
        * how long user has been on the site for their first time
        * if the user make a purchase for that first time
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') 


  JOIN



  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)



  USING (fullVisitorId) 
;   
```


## Task 3. Evaluate classification model performance

in query editor 

* to evaluate the model based on the ROC
    * we have a evaluation human-readable metric, the MODEL in question, then we need a "test-against" dataset, here its whatever grab the training dataset
```sql
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)

));
```

* roc not that good 


## Improve model performance with feature engineering



* here we add more features
    * we ask about the customers viewing metrics and how they got to the site
    * we ask about their demographics
    * maximum checkout progress each visitor reached in their session, which is recorded in the field hits.eCommerceAction.action_type. I

* we get a better roc_auc


## Task 7. Predict which new visitors will come back and purchase
